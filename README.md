# Practical_Machine_Learning
Repository for assignments and course material from the Practical Machine Learning course on Coursera
In this folder I have my Machine Learning Project submission in three formats: rmd, html, and pdf. The pdf should open in GitHub, the html file will need to be opened separately in a browser (i.e. download file, open in browser).
